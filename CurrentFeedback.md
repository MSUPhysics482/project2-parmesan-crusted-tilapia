Fellas, I think I have a much better idea of what you are intending to do. I think that working out "how a rainbow" works in detail is a pretty good project. I suspect that you can use a lot of the tools that we've developed in class, but now you will have to take into account the dielecrtic properties and the conductivity of a typical water droplet. The computer can come in when you start looking at precisely how a spectrum is produced. I would expect a little extension beyond the flat glass to some curved surface (or how rainbows actually occur through a second reflection). What is lacking from this writeup is a detailed timeline that is needed to understand if you will be able to complete this project in the allotted time, but the scope seems right to me. Good job!
